# 🧠 Migraine Attack Analysis & Prediction

## 📌 Overview

This project leverages a medical dataset to predict the **likelihood and severity of migraine attacks** using exploratory data analysis (EDA).

The analysis includes a wide variety of **statistical methods** to understand the nature of the data, its distribution, and possible influencing factors. The data is **preprocessed, analyzed, visualized**, and **modeled** to extract insights and make predictive assessments.

## 📁 Repository Contents

A **migraine** is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of moderate to severe headache, often accompanied by symptoms such as **nausea**, **vomiting**, and **sensitivity to light and sound**. The headache typically presents as a **throbbing or pulsating pain**, usually on one side of the head, lasting from a few hours to several days and significantly impacting daily life.

Key attributes analyzed include:

- Age  
- Location of pain  
- Nature of pain  
- Frequency  
- Duration  
- Intensity  
- Other relevant factors (based on dataset)
