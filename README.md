# Overview

This project leverages a medical dataset to predict the likelihood and severity of migraine attacks using exploratory data analysis.

The analysis includes a wide variety of statistical methods to understand the nature of the data, its distribution, and possible influencing factors. The data is preprocessed, analyzed, visualized, and modeled to extract insights and make predictive assessments.

#📁 Repository Contents

A migraine is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of moderate to severe headache, often accompanied by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. The headache typically presents as a throbbing or pulsating pain, usually on one side of the head, and can last from a few hours to several days and can significantly impact daily life.

Key attributes analyzed may include age, location of the pain, nature of pain, frequency, duration & intensity and more depending on the dataset.
